# Discord Music Bot

In This tutorial Series I am explaining you how to do an advanced Music Bot in Discord, using the Distube Package

It is fast and very good!

First I will explain in several videos how to do specific Commands from skip to forward and lyrics!

After that i will cover some more backend stuff, like adding reactions, filters, how to use cookies, spotify playlist supports etc. etc.

## Installation | How to use the Bot

 **1.** Install [node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode) or higher

 **2.** Download this and unzip it    |    or git clone it

 **3.** Install all of the packages with **`npm install`**

 **4** Fill in the parameters, RIGHT in `./botconfig/config.json`!

 **5.** start the bot with **`node index.js`**

#### **NOTE:**

*If you are having errors/problems with starting delete the package.json file and do, before you install the packages `npm init`*

*MAKE SURE THAT THE BOT HAS ADMIN*
